                        <b>Adequate Policy Maximum</b>— Since this is essentially the limit that your insurance
                        policy will pay towards your medical bills, colleges and universities often require their
                        international students to purchase a plan with a policy maximum of at least $50,000.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Relatively Low Deductible</b> — To help keep students out of pocket costs as low as
                        possible, schools often include a deductible limit per condition, or per policy period,
                        as part of their waiver requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mental Health Coverage </b>— To help ensure students are both physically and mentally
                        healthy, outside health insurance plans are generally required provide both in-patient
                        and out-patient mental health care, either at a set dollar amount or a percentage per
                        visit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Maternity Coverage</b> — As a preventative measure, adequate maternity coverage is
                        another popular health insurance waiver requirement for international students.
                        Schools don't generally require maternity to be covered at a specific dollar amount,
                        and instead request a high percentage to be covered, typically at least 80% coverage
                        in-network for pre-natal, delivery and post-natal care.
